Page Object Model project testing Utah Avalanche Center website
The purpose of this repo is learning and practicing construction of the Page Object Model tests. 
The current status of this repo is In Progress. I will update this status to Complete when I feel that I am ready to move on to other projects. 
I choose the Utah Avalanche Center's website as the subject. 
It has many pages that are updated on a daily basis, including text, images, and videos. 
There is a report submission function, a search function, and online sales functionality. 
My goal is to build an automated test suite that remains relavant through all the updates.
